# API Design

## One-Line Summary

**APIs are contracts. A well-designed API is predictable, consistent, and self-explanatory — a bad one is a source of constant confusion for everyone, including you six months later.**

## Theoretical Origin

- **REST (Representational State Transfer)** — Roy Fielding's PhD dissertation, UC Irvine, 2000. Defined as an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.
- **Richardson Maturity Model** (Leonard Richardson, 2008) — 4 levels of REST "maturity" (0: plain HTTP, 1: Resources, 2: HTTP Verbs, 3: Hypermedia).
- *RESTful Web APIs* (Richardson & Ruby, 2013) — practical REST guide.
- *API Design Patterns* (JJ Geewax, Google, 2021) — patterns from building APIs at scale.
- **OpenAPI Specification** (formerly Swagger) — the industry standard for documenting REST APIs, maintained by the OpenAPI Initiative.

## Core Concepts

### Resources, Not Actions

REST is about *things* (resources), not *verbs* (actions). The HTTP method is the verb; the URL is the noun.

**Wrong** (action-based):
```
POST /getUser
POST /createOrder
POST /deleteProduct
```

**Right** (resource-based):
```
GET    /users/123
POST   /orders
DELETE /products/456
```

---

### HTTP Methods and What They Mean

| Method | Meaning | Idempotent? | Safe? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GET** | Fetch a resource | Yes | Yes |
| **POST** | Create a new resource | No | No |
| **PUT** | Replace a resource entirely | Yes | No |
| **PATCH** | Update part of a resource | No | No |
| **DELETE** | Remove a resource | Yes | No |

**Idempotent** = calling it multiple times has the same result as calling it once.
**Safe** = doesn't change server state.

Why this matters: browsers, proxies, and caches treat GET differently from POST. Misusing methods breaks these expectations.

---

### URL Design Patterns

**Collections and items**:
```
GET    /users           → list all users
POST   /users           → create a user
GET    /users/123       → get user 123
PUT    /users/123       → replace user 123
PATCH  /users/123       → update user 123 partially
DELETE /users/123       → delete user 123
```

**Nested resources** (when the relationship is strong):
```
GET /users/123/orders        → orders belonging to user 123
GET /users/123/orders/456    → specific order of user 123
```

**Flat relationships** (when the nested resource exists independently):
```
# Prefer flat if orders can exist without a specific user context
GET /orders?userId=123       → orders filtered by user
```

**Rule of thumb**: Nest at most 2 levels deep. `/a/:id/b/:id` is acceptable. `/a/:id/b/:id/c/:id/d/:id` is a smell.

### Health & Status Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Basic liveness check (returns 200 if server is running) |
| `GET /health/ready` | Readiness check (returns 200 if all dependencies are connected) |
| `GET /version` | Returns app version, git commit hash (useful for debugging deployments) |

These are not resources but operational endpoints. Every API should have at least `GET /health`.

**Naming conventions**:
```
# Use plural nouns for collections
/users, /orders, /products    ✓
/user, /order, /product       ✗ (singular is inconsistent)

# Use kebab-case for multi-word resources
/user-profiles                ✓
/userProfiles, /user_profiles ✗ (both work, but pick one and be consistent)

# No verbs in URLs (the HTTP method is the verb)
GET /users/123/activate       ✗ (action as URL)
POST /users/123/activations   ✓ (activation is a resource)
POST /users/123?action=activate ✗ (also wrong)
```

---

## HTTP Status Codes

Use status codes accurately. Returning `200 OK` with `{ "success": false }` in the body is a lie — use the right status code.

### Success (2xx)
| Code | Name | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **200 OK** | Everything worked | GET, PUT, PATCH success |
| **201 Created** | Resource created | POST success (return the created resource + Location header) |
| **204 No Content** | Success, nothing to return | DELETE success |

### Client Errors (4xx — it's the caller's fault)
| Code | Name | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **400 Bad Request** | Invalid input | Missing required field, wrong data type, validation failure |
| **401 Unauthorized** | Not authenticated | No token, expired token (despite the name, this is about authentication) |
| **403 Forbidden** | Not authorized | Authenticated but lacks permission for this resource |
| **404 Not Found** | Resource doesn't exist | Wrong ID, or hiding existence for security reasons |
| **409 Conflict** | State conflict | Creating a duplicate, version mismatch (optimistic locking) |
| **422 Unprocessable Entity** | Semantic validation failure | Request is well-formed but business rules fail |
| **429 Too Many Requests** | Rate limited | Include `Retry-After` header |

### Server Errors (5xx — it's the server's fault)
| Code | Name | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **500 Internal Server Error** | Unexpected server crash | Unhandled exception, bug in the code |
| **502 Bad Gateway** | Upstream service down | Your server can't reach the DB or external service |
| **503 Service Unavailable** | Intentional unavailability | Maintenance mode, overloaded |

**Common mistake**: Using 500 for all errors. Discipline yourself to return 400-level for client errors — it helps consumers of your API debug much faster.

## Error Response Structure

Consistent error responses are as important as consistent success responses. Pick a format and stick to it everywhere.

**Recommended structure**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "Must be a valid email address"
      },
      {
        "field": "age",
        "message": "Must be a positive integer"
      }
    ],
    "request_id": "req_abc123"
  }
}
```

**Key fields**:
- `code` — machine-readable string (for programmatic handling)
- `message` — human-readable string (for developers debugging)
- `details` — array for validation errors with per-field context
- `request_id` — correlates with server logs (invaluable for support)

**What not to do**:
```json
// Too vague — what went wrong?
{ "error": "Error" }

// Stack trace exposed to client
{ "error": "NullPointerException at line 234 in UserService.java" }

// Inconsistent — sometimes it's "error", sometimes "message", sometimes "err"
{ "message": "not found" }  // on one endpoint
{ "error": "User not found" }  // on another
```

---

## Pagination

Never return unbounded lists. An endpoint that returns all orders eventually times out or OOMs.

### Offset Pagination (simpler, but has issues)
```
GET /orders?page=3&limit=20

Response:
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 3,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 847,
    "total_pages": 43
  }
}
```

**Problem**: If items are inserted between page 1 and page 2 being fetched, some items are skipped or duplicated.

### Cursor Pagination (more robust)
```
GET /orders?cursor=eyJpZCI6MTAwfQ==&limit=20

Response:
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6MTIwfQ==",
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

The cursor encodes the position in the result set (often a Base64-encoded ID or timestamp). Insertions don't cause skips.

**When to use which**:
- Offset: admin tables, reporting, when "jump to page 42" is needed
- Cursor: infinite scroll, real-time feeds, large datasets, sorted by timestamp

## Versioning

APIs change. Without versioning, you can't change your API without breaking existing clients.

### URL Path Versioning (most common)
```
GET /v1/users
GET /v2/users
```

**Pros**: Obvious, simple, easy to route, easy to document separately.
**Cons**: URL "should" represent a resource, not a version (philosophical).

### Header Versioning
```
GET /users
Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v2+json
```

**Pros**: Cleaner URLs.
**Cons**: Hidden — hard to test in browser, easy to forget.

**Recommendation**: Use URL versioning (`/v1/`) unless you have a specific reason not to. It's the most discoverable and widely understood approach.

### Versioning policy
- Increment major version (`v1` → `v2`) for breaking changes
- Breaking changes: removing fields, changing field types, changing behavior
- Non-breaking additions (new optional fields, new endpoints) don't require a new version
- Maintain previous version for at least 6–12 months with deprecation notice
- Add `Deprecation: true` and `Sunset: <date>` headers to deprecated endpoints

---

## Rate Limiting

Protect your API from abuse and overload. Include headers so clients can self-regulate.

```
# Response headers
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100        # requests allowed per window
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 47     # requests left in current window
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1714300800 # Unix timestamp when window resets

# When limit exceeded
HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 30               # seconds until retry is safe
```

**Common limits by tier**:
- Free/unauthenticated: 60 req/hour
- Authenticated users: 1,000 req/hour
- Premium/API key: 10,000 req/hour

---

## API Documentation with OpenAPI

OpenAPI (Swagger) is the standard. Tools generate docs, client SDKs, and test scaffolding from it.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: My App API
  version: 1.0.0

paths:
  /users/{id}:
    get:
      summary: Get a user by ID
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: integer
      responses:
        '200':
          description: User found
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
        '404':
          description: User not found
```

**Tooling**:
- **Swagger UI** — interactive browser-based API explorer
- **Redoc** — clean static documentation
- **Postman** — import OpenAPI to generate a collection
- **FastAPI / NestJS** — generate OpenAPI automatically from code annotations

## GraphQL vs REST — When to Choose

| Dimension | REST | GraphQL |
|---|---|---|
| Learning curve | Low | Medium-high |
| Over-fetching | Common | Eliminated (client specifies fields) |
| Under-fetching / N+1 | Common (multiple requests) | Handled in one query |
| Caching | Easy (HTTP caching) | Harder (all POST to /graphql) |
| Tooling maturity | Excellent | Good, improving |
| Type safety | Via OpenAPI/TypeScript | Built-in |
| Best for | Public APIs, simple CRUD, mobile with predictable data needs | Complex queries, many client types, dashboard-heavy apps |

**Rule of thumb**:
- < 5 client consumers with predictable data needs → REST
- Multiple client types (web, mobile, third-party) with divergent data needs → GraphQL
- AI-generated CRUD app → REST (simpler, more AI training data)

## Vibe Coder Consistency Checklist

AI-generated APIs frequently have consistency problems. Check for:

- [ ] All endpoints return the same JSON structure for errors (same `error` field shape)
- [ ] HTTP methods match semantics (GET for fetches, POST for creates, etc.)
- [ ] Status codes are accurate (not returning 200 for errors)
- [ ] Collection endpoints have pagination (not returning 10,000 records)
- [ ] All timestamps use the same format (ISO 8601: `2026-04-16T09:30:00Z`)
- [ ] IDs are the same type everywhere (all integers, or all strings — not mixed)
- [ ] URL naming is consistent (all plural, all kebab-case, or all snake_case — choose one)
- [ ] Authentication scheme is consistent (Bearer token on all endpoints, not just some)
- [ ] API versioned before going public (changing `/users` to `/v1/users` after clients exist is painful)

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Chatty APIs** — 10 requests to build one page. Design endpoints around use cases, not data models.
- **God endpoints** — `POST /do-stuff` that does different things based on a `type` parameter. Split into real resources.
- **Exposing your database schema** — if your API is 1:1 with your DB tables, changes to your DB break your clients. Add a translation layer.
- **Boolean parameters everywhere** — `?format=true&expand=true&verbose=true` is unclear. Use explicit resource paths or fields parameters.
- **Ignoring backwards compatibility** — removing a field breaks every client using it. Add fields freely; remove carefully and with versioning.
- **Inconsistent auth** — some endpoints need auth, some don't, with no clear pattern. Document and make it predictable.

## Over-Application Warning

API design principles exist for long-lived APIs with multiple consumers. Calibrate accordingly:

- **Personal project**: RESTful URLs and correct status codes are enough. Don't write OpenAPI docs for an app only you use.
- **Early MVP**: Consistency > perfection. Pick a convention and stick to it. Don't redesign before you know what your clients actually need.
- **Public API**: Versioning, rate limiting, and full OpenAPI docs are non-negotiable before launch.
- **Internal microservices**: gRPC or tRPC may be more appropriate than REST — especially if all consumers are in the same language.

## Limitations

1. **REST is architectural style, not a standard** — implementations vary widely, leading to "REST-ish" APIs that everyone calls REST
2. **HTTP caching is powerful but ignored** — most REST APIs don't leverage ETags or Cache-Control effectively
3. **Hypermedia (HATEOAS) rarely adopted** — Roy Fielding's Level 3 REST (links in responses) is rarely practical in real-world APIs
4. **File uploads are awkward** — REST + JSON doesn't handle multipart/form-data elegantly; often requires a separate pattern
5. **Real-time data** — REST is request/response. For real-time, add WebSockets or SSE alongside REST (not instead of it)

## Related Frameworks

- `hexagonal` — API layer is an "inbound port". Hexagonal helps keep domain logic out of controllers.
- `twelve-factor` — Factor VII (Port Binding) and Factor III (Config for API keys/tokens)
- `owasp-security` — A01 (Broken Access Control) and A03 (Injection) are the most common API vulnerabilities
