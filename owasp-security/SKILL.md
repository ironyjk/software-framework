# OWASP Security Framework

## One-Line Summary

**The 10 most dangerous security mistakes in web apps — a checklist every builder must run before shipping, especially if AI wrote your code.**

## Theoretical Origin

- **OWASP Foundation** (Open Web Application Security Project) — non-profit, founded 2001.
- OWASP Top 10 has been the industry's standard security checklist since 2003, updated every few years.
- The 2021 edition (current as of 2026) is based on CVE data, community surveys, and real breach analysis.
- Referenced by NIST, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, and most compliance frameworks worldwide.

## OWASP Top 10 (2021 Edition)

### A01 — Broken Access Control
**What it means**: Users can do things they shouldn't be allowed to do.

Examples:
- User A can view User B's order history by changing the URL (`/orders/1234` → `/orders/1235`)
- Normal user can access `/admin` just by knowing the URL
- API returns more data than the UI shows (IDOR — Insecure Direct Object Reference)

**Check**:
- [ ] Every API endpoint verifies that the requesting user owns/has permission for the resource
- [ ] Admin routes are protected server-side, not just hidden from the UI
- [ ] Tests exist for "can User A access User B's data?"

---

### A02 — Cryptographic Failures
**What it means**: Sensitive data is stored or transmitted without proper encryption.

Examples:
- Passwords stored in plain text or as MD5 hashes
- Credit card numbers in a plain-text database column
- HTTP instead of HTTPS (data in transit unencrypted)

**Check**:
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt, argon2, or scrypt (NOT MD5, SHA1)
- [ ] Sensitive data columns encrypted at rest
- [ ] Site forces HTTPS (HSTS header set)

---

### A03 — Injection
**What it means**: Attacker sends malicious code that your app executes. SQL Injection is the classic example.

Example (SQL Injection):
```python
# DANGEROUS — never do this
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + user_input + "'"

# SAFE — parameterized query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

Also applies to: command injection, LDAP injection, template injection.

**Check**:
- [ ] All DB queries use parameterized queries or ORM (never string concatenation)
- [ ] No `exec()`, `eval()`, or `os.system()` with user input
- [ ] Search for all places where user input touches a query or shell command

---

### A04 — Insecure Design
**What it means**: Security wasn't thought about during design, so fixing it later requires architecture changes.

Examples:
- Password reset sends the new password via email instead of a secure token
- "Security through obscurity" — hiding an admin panel at `/xk923admin` instead of requiring authentication

**Check**:
- [ ] Threat modeling done before building sensitive features (even a 30-minute whiteboard session counts)
- [ ] "What's the worst thing a malicious user could do here?" asked for each feature

---

### A05 — Security Misconfiguration
**What it means**: Default settings left unchanged, unnecessary features enabled, or error messages expose internals.

Examples:
- Default admin credentials (`admin/admin`) not changed
- Stack traces shown to users in production (leaks file paths, library versions)
- S3 bucket or database open to the public internet
- CORS set to `*` (any origin allowed)

**Check**:
- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] Production error responses return generic messages (not stack traces)
- [ ] Cloud storage buckets are private unless explicitly public
- [ ] CORS origin list is specific, not `*`

---

### A06 — Vulnerable and Outdated Components
**What it means**: You're using libraries with known security holes.

**Check**:
- [ ] Run `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `bundle audit`, or `trivy` regularly
- [ ] Dependencies updated at least quarterly
- [ ] Automated dependency update tools configured (Dependabot, Renovate)

---

### A07 — Identification and Authentication Failures
**What it means**: Login and session management implemented incorrectly.

Examples:
- No rate limiting on login (brute-force possible)
- Session tokens don't expire
- JWTs with `alg: none` accepted (yes, this is real)
- Password reset tokens that never expire

**Check**:
- [ ] Login endpoint rate-limited (e.g., 5 attempts/minute per IP)
- [ ] Sessions expire after inactivity
- [ ] JWT library validates `alg` field strictly
- [ ] Password reset tokens expire within 15–60 minutes

---

### A08 — Software and Data Integrity Failures
**What it means**: App trusts data or code without verifying it.

Examples:
- Installing npm packages without checking integrity (supply chain attacks)
- Auto-updating from an untrusted CDN
- Deserializing user-provided objects without validation

**Check**:
- [ ] Use `npm ci` (uses lockfile) instead of `npm install` in CI/CD
- [ ] Verify checksums of downloaded binaries
- [ ] Never deserialize user input directly into objects

---

### A09 — Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
**What it means**: You won't know when you're being attacked or breached.

**Check**:
- [ ] Login failures and access denials logged
- [ ] Logs are centralized and monitored (not just written to a file on the server)
- [ ] Alerts set for suspicious patterns (many failed logins, unusual data access)

---

### A10 — Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**What it means**: Attacker tricks your server into making requests to internal systems.

Example: Your app has a feature "fetch this URL for me". Attacker sends `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (AWS metadata endpoint) to steal cloud credentials.

**Check**:
- [ ] URLs fetched server-side are validated against an allowlist
- [ ] Internal network addresses (10.x, 172.x, 169.254.x) blocked for user-provided URLs

---

## Vibe Coder Danger Zone

These are the mistakes AI-generated code most commonly makes:

### 1. API Keys Hard-Coded in Source
```python
# What AI often generates (DANGEROUS)
openai_key = "sk-abc123..."

# What it should be
import os
openai_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
```
Hard-coded secrets will end up in Git history. Once in GitHub, assume they're compromised within minutes (bots scan GitHub continuously).

### 2. SQL Injection via f-strings
AI frequently uses f-strings or string concatenation when building queries. Always ask: "Are you using parameterized queries?"

### 3. No Rate Limiting
AI builds the feature, forgets the protection. Every login form, password reset, and API endpoint that costs money needs rate limiting.

### 4. HTTPS Not Enforced
AI generates the app; deployment to HTTP-only hosting is the developer's responsibility. If your platform supports it, enable "force HTTPS" on day one.

### 5. `.env` Committed to Git
```gitignore
# Your .gitignore MUST include:
.env
.env.local
.env.production
*.pem
```

## Secret Management Primer

| Stage | Solution | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Local dev | `.env` file (never commit) | `python-dotenv`, `dotenv` npm package |
| Small production | Platform env vars | Vercel, Railway, Heroku env settings |
| Medium production | Secret manager | AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager |
| Regulated/enterprise | Vault (HashiCorp) | Rotation, audit trail, fine-grained ACL |

Rule of thumb: If you can see the secret value in your source code, it's wrong.

---

## Authentication / Authorization Basics

**Authentication** = "Who are you?" (login)
**Authorization** = "What are you allowed to do?" (permissions)

These are different problems. Getting auth right is hard — reuse existing solutions:

| Option | When to use |
|---|---|
| Auth0, Clerk, Supabase Auth | Solo/small team, fast MVP |
| NextAuth.js, Passport.js | Node.js app, want control |
| Firebase Auth | Mobile-first, Google ecosystem |
| Rolling your own | Almost never. Seriously. |

If you must roll your own:
- Use established JWT libraries, don't implement JWT parsing yourself
- Refresh tokens + short-lived access tokens (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
- Always verify token on the server side — never trust client-side-only checks

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **"Security theater"** — changing the admin URL to `/xk923admin` instead of requiring authentication
- **Trusting the frontend** — any check done only in JavaScript can be bypassed. Always validate server-side.
- **Overly verbose error messages** — `"User 'john@example.com' does not exist"` tells attackers which emails are registered
- **"We're too small to be attacked"** — automated bots attack everything. Size doesn't matter.
- **Security audit once, done forever** — dependencies get vulnerabilities over time. Schedule recurring checks.

## Over-Application Warning

Security is important, but paralysis is also a failure mode:

- An MVP that never ships because you're perfecting auth is not useful
- For a personal side project with no sensitive data, start with the top 5, not all 10
- Use managed auth (Auth0, Clerk) and managed hosting (Vercel, Railway) — they handle much of this for you
- Ship with basic security, then harden iteratively as the app grows and gains real users

The right question is not "Is this perfectly secure?" but "Is this secure *enough* for the current stage and risk level?"

## Practical Checklist (Ship-Time)

Before going live, run this:

- [ ] No secrets in source code or `.env` committed to Git
- [ ] All DB queries parameterized
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Passwords hashed (bcrypt/argon2)
- [ ] Login rate-limited
- [ ] Session expiry set
- [ ] Error messages are generic in production
- [ ] `npm audit` / `pip-audit` run and critical issues resolved
- [ ] CORS configured (not `*` if you have auth)
- [ ] Access control: every API endpoint checks ownership/role

---

## Limitations

1. **OWASP Top 10 is not exhaustive** — it covers the most common, not all possible vulnerabilities
2. **Context-dependent** — a static marketing site has different risk than a fintech app
3. **Compliance ≠ Security** — passing a PCI-DSS audit doesn't mean you're actually secure
4. **Social engineering and phishing** — outside technical OWASP scope, but the most common real-world attack vector

## Related Frameworks

- `twelve-factor` — Factor III (Config) directly addresses secret management
- `hexagonal` — isolating I/O at boundaries makes injection attacks easier to contain
- `observability` — A09 (Logging/Monitoring) is a shared concern
